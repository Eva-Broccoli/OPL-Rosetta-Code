REM Psion devices up to Series 5 have no colour, so the pixel is black.  The Series 7 and later do have colour, but I don't own any of those, so I can neither test it nor am I familiar with OPL beyond Series 5.
REM The Series 3 also has a resolution of only 480x160, so the window falls off the screen.
